Platform: M5 Atom Matrix on top of a M5Stack AtomPortABC
and following I2C devices, via a M5Stack GROVE HUB, connected to AtomPortABC, port A:
1) M5Stack OLED unit;
2) M5Stack RTC unit.

Note: This is a new flash after the last flash bricked the Atom Matrix.
On internet I found that I have to short 2 pads marked D0, which are to the left of the USB connecter,
on the Atom Matrix main board. While trying to clean the solder pads of D0 I probably damaged the 
connection for the LED Matrix board. Since then only about 3 LEDs of the Matrix board flash shortly
but none of the LEDs of the Matrix lit under program control.
